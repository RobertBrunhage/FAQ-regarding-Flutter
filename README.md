# FAQ regarding Flutter
In the development of Flutter, a lot of questions come up. To answer them, Robert Brunhage, Tadas Petra and I (Tomic Riedel) have decided to create a constantly growing document in which we want to answer as many questions as possible. How do I learn Flutter, which StateManagement Solution is the best and how can I use Firebase? All such questions will be answered in this project.

You can find all questions in the "Questions" folder.

## How to ask a question
You have your own question and want us to answer it and include it in the document? That's easy: You create an issue in this repository, post your question there and explain it as detailed as possible. Once you have done this, it may take 1-2 days for your question to be answered. We will respond to your issue as soon as we have included your question in the document!

Oh, and please always remember: no matter how stupid your question may sound, ask it!

## How to answer one or more questions and edit the document
We are very happy if you like this project so much that you want to actively participate in it. Please contact Tomic R.#7081 on Discord or send Tomic a direct message on Twitter (https://twitter.com/tomicriedel). Thank you for your support on this project!

## You want to improve something or make a suggestion for improvement?

If you want to improve something directly, feel free to create a pull request. The moderation team will then look at your changes and either accept or reject it. If you only have a suggestion and just want to see if the idea is accepted and if a moderator will implement it, then feel free to create an issue. We will respond within 1-2 days.

Again, we say no suggestion for improvement is stupid. Just ask, we will see what we make of it!

## How to get a moderator
So if you want to do this, my full respect âœŠ!

We are very happy that you want to be part of it, but you must meet a few criteria, because you lead a very large responsibility.

In any case you have to have at least the Helper role on the Discord server of Robert Brunhage and Tadas Petra (https://discord.gg/NcRT4bPc75). You get this role if you actively help other people on the server and answer their questions. If you have achieved this, then you are already quite a bit further with your application. Finally you have to apply for the role of a moderator, because not every helper is a moderator automatically. 

You can fill out the application here: https://forms.gle/zLN8UR2nakZmdu8L6
