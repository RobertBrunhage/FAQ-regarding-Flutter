# State Management
**Q**: what is the best state management solution?
**A**: There is no "best" state management solution. You should use the one you like the most.

**Q**: Is GetX good for big applications?
**A**: You will be fine but remember that you still need to know Flutter. GetX is really good at hiding a lot of things that are good to know.

**Q**: Can anyone explain **Provider** vs **Riverpod** vs **GetX**
**A**:  Provider is not compile-safe while Riverpod is. 
In Provider you can’t declare multiple providers of the same type, while in Riverpod, you can do this without overriding the others.
You can declare the provider and its class without scattering the app’s root file in Riverpod In Riverpod, the providers are declared globally and can be used anywhere in the app using either the **Consumer** widget or **context.read** In Provider, dependency can lead to horribly nested code, while it’s easy in Riverpod for a provider to consume another using **ProviderReference**.
